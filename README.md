## How to add a new package

We have the hello-world package for a template, which contains the following files:

- README.md
- LICENSE
- <package_name>.sh

You must follow this template in the pull request adding a new package. If you're unsure about which license, see [Choose A License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/).

License file is optional if you want to use the License of the actual repository.

## What not to do in your packages

- Do not add malicious code.
